    "### Generate embeddings and Load them into Azure Cache for Redis\n",
    "Using LangChain, this example connects to Azure OpenAI Service to generate embeddings for the dataset. These embeddings are then loaded into [Azure Cache for Redis](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview), a fully managed Redis service on Azure. Make sure you're using the [Enterprise tier](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/quickstart-create-redis-enterprise) of Azure Cache for Redis, which features the [RediSearch](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-redis-modules#redisearch) module that includes vector search capability. Finally, a copy of the index schema is saved. That is useful for loading the index into Redis later if you don't want to regenerate the embeddings."
